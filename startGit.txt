First time we can create ripo(as same as folder) with command prompt
git init   (it create ripository in local folder)
git add . (add all file)
git commit -m "message"
git remote add origin https://github.com/suttipo/LearnGit.git (add github repository)
git branch -m master main (change branch master to main)
git push -u origin main (push file to github)
**warning in editor you must save file every time you edit it before you add and commit.

To list all local branches and identify the current branch:

git branch (This command lists all local branches in your repository. 
The current branch is indicated by an asterisk (*) next to its name. 
To list all remote branches.)

To list all remote branches.

git branch -r (This command displays all branches found in your configured 
remote repositories.)

To list both local and remote branches:

 git branch -a (This command provides a comprehensive list, showing both your 
 local branches and all remote branches.)

To show only the name of the current branch (Git 2.22+):

git branch --show-current (This command outputs only the name of the currently checked-out
branch, which is useful for scripting. It outputs nothing if you are in a detached
HEAD state.)

To view detailed information about a remote repository, including its branches:

git remote show <remote_name> (Replace <remote_name> with the name of your remote 
(e.g., origin). This command provides details about the remote, including its URL,
fetch and push URLs, and the branches it contains.)
